# Better Minecraft Development (Work in Progress)

**Better Minecraft Development** is a suite of development tools designed to streamline the process of creating Minecraft plugins, mods, and related projects. It currently supports multiple IDEs, including IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, and Neovim, making it easy for developers to write, manage, and test Minecraft projects within their preferred environment. The project aims to provide first-class support for Minecraft plugin development, intelligent code generation, integrated server management, and advanced debugging capabilities.

## Features

### 1. **IntelliJ IDEA Plugin (Work in Progress)**

- **Code Completion & Refactoring**: Leverages IntelliJ's powerful PSI (Program Structure Interface) for context-aware code completion, inspections, and automated refactorings.
- **Integrated Debugging**: Full debugging support, including breakpoints, watch windows, and call stacks.
- **Minecraft Project Management**: Effortlessly manage Minecraft plugin projects with automatic scaffolding and server deployment.

### 2. **Visual Studio Code Extension (Work in Progress)**

- **Custom Views & Language Support**: Utilizes the VS Code Extension API for advanced customization and enhanced language support.
- **Integrated Debugging**: Debugging tools built into VS Code, including setting breakpoints and inspecting variables.
- **Minecraft Project Templates**: Easily generate Minecraft plugin scaffolds and templates to get started quickly.

### 3. **Eclipse Plugin (Work in Progress)**

- **OSGi Tooling**: Built with Eclipse PDE (Plug-in Development Environment), offering tools for creating and managing OSGi-based Minecraft plugins.
- **Manifest & Packaging Tools**: Automatically generate `plugin.yml` and handle JAR packaging for Spigot/Bukkit projects.
- **Integrated Server Management**: Seamlessly deploy plugins to local or remote Minecraft servers for testing and debugging.

### 4. **Neovim Plugin (Work in Progress)**

- **Remote Plugin Architecture**: Integrates with Neovim’s RPC API, enabling interaction with Lua or Python hooks for Minecraft development.
- **Syntax Highlighting & Autocompletion**: Offers smart autocompletion and syntax checks for Minecraft plugin code.
- **Minimalistic Integration**: Leverage Neovim's fast, lightweight interface for developers who prefer a terminal-based experience.

### 5. **Integrated Server Management (Work in Progress)**

- **Minecraft Server Controls**: Start, stop, and manage Minecraft server instances directly from your IDE’s interface.
- **Live Testing**: Deploy plugins to your Minecraft server from within the IDE, allowing for instant testing.
- **Log Monitoring**: Monitor server logs in real time, directly integrated into your IDE’s UI.

### 6. **Intelligent Code Generation (Work in Progress)**

- **Auto-generate Plugin Scaffolds**: Create standard plugin files like `plugin.yml` for Bukkit/Spigot or similar for other Minecraft platforms.
- **Pre-configured Templates**: Customize templates for quickly generating the structure of your Minecraft plugin projects.

## Supported Platforms

- **IntelliJ IDEA** (Community & Ultimate)
- **Visual Studio Code** on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Eclipse IDE** (any Eclipse release with PDE)
- **Neovim** (v0.8+ with RPC support)
